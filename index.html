        <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        <p>I love science. Starting in middle school, I already learnt a lot from doing chemical experiments. I also love studying physics after I entered high school, which also costs me two years to study for the Chines Physics Olympaid.Although I am not
            studying in the field of natural science anymore, I do find my interest in the computing science, which is a more theoretical part of the subject: computing theory and algorithm design.

            After I entered college, I found myself interested in film photography. To take film photos, it requires one to know the concept of shutter, the aperture etc. I love taking photos in film not only because it is a relatively old form of art, but also because
            it can preserve a physical copy of photo on the film, which can be rarely seen inside a digital world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the day I took my first film photo, I start to take on a journey of recording my path of life,those unforgettable moments of my life and the people that are important to me.

            I also love music. Music is the common language of mankind, and it is really beautiful when you play it, or even just listen to it.I learnt how to play GuZheng when I was 8 years old and I only learnt it for 2 years. I quit learning GuZheng because I
            am not a big fan of traditional Chinies music. After that, I learnt how to play guitar and ukulele by myself. When I was year 2 student in college, I start to wonder, why not learn an instrument that could let you perform in an orchestra?
            With that thought hold in mind, I start to learn violin and until now I am still learning it.
