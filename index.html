        <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        <p> I love science. Starting in middle school, I already learned a lot from doing chemical experiments. I also love studying physics after I entered high school, which also costs me two years to study for the Chines Physics Olympiad.Although I am
            not studying in the field of natural science anymore, I do find my interest in computing science, which is a more theoretical part of the subject: computing theory and algorithm design.

            After I entered college, I found myself interested in film photography. To take film photos requires one to know the concept of the shutter, the aperture, etc. I love taking photos in the film not only because it is a relatively old form of art, but also
            because it can preserve a physical copy of the photo on the film, which can be rarely seen inside a digital world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the day I took my first film photo, I start to take on a journey of recording my path of life, those unforgettable moments of my life, and the people that are important to me.

            I also love music. Music is the common language of mankind, and it is really beautiful when you play it, or even just listen to it. I learned how to play GuZheng when I was 8 years old and I only learned it for 2 years. I quit learning GuZheng because
            I am not a big fan of traditional Chinese music. After that, I learned how to play guitar and ukulele by myself. When I was a year 2 student in college, I start to wonder, why not learn an instrument that could let you perform in an orchestra?
            With that thought hold in mind, I start to learn violin and until now I am still learning it.
