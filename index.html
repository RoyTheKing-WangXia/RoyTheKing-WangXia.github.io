        <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        <p>I love science. <br> Starting in middle school, I already learnt a lot from doing chemical experiments.<br> I also love studying physics after I entered high school, <br> which also costs me two years to study for the Chines Physics Olympaid.<br>            Although I am not studying in the field of natural science anymore,<br> I do find my interest in the computing science, <br> which is a more theoretical part of the subject: <br> computing theory and algorithm design.</p>
        <p>
            After I entered college, I found myself interested in film photography.<br> To take film photos, it requires one to know the concept of shutter, the aperture etc.<br> I love taking photos in film not only because it is a relatively old form
            of art,<br> but also because it can preserve a physical copy of photo on the film,<br> which can be rarely seen inside a digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the day I took my first film photo, <br> I start to take on a journey of recording my path of life,<br> those unforgettable moments of my life and the people that are important to me.<br> I also love music. <br> Music is the common language
            of mankind, and it is really beautiful when you play it, <br> or even just listen to it.
